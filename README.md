# NN-from-scratch-for-multiclass-problem
Coursework project (group of 3) using Python. Deep learning models, evaluators and hyper-parameters were built from scratch (help taken from class' lab materials). It involved classification using deep learning model with modules built such as dropout, batch normalization, weight decay and Xavier initialization.
